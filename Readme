# PowerCo Customer Churn Prediction Project

## Introduction

This project was completed as part of the **BCG x Forage Virtual Job Simulation**.  
I worked in the role of a **Junior Data Scientist**, analyzing customer churn for PowerCo, a major simulated utility provider for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).

The goal was to:
- Diagnose reasons for customer churn.
- Build a predictive model to identify at-risk customers.
- Recommend actions based on the findings.

## Key Highlights

- **Churn Rate**: 9.7% across approximately 14,600 customers.
- **Model Used**: Random Forest Classifier with 800 estimators and balanced class weights.
- **Key Findings**:
  - Churn prediction is possible, but **price sensitivity is not the main driver**.
  - **Top churn drivers**: yearly consumption, forecasted consumption, and net margin.
  - **Discount strategies** can be effective if targeted at **high-value, high-risk customers**.

## What I Learned

- Importance of handling **imbalanced datasets** when churn events are rare.
- Why **recall for churners** is more important than overall accuracy in churn models.
- How to apply **feature engineering** to improve model performance.
- Practical experience adjusting **prediction thresholds** to improve recall.
- Translating model outputs into **business recommendations** for client action.

## Acknowledgment

This project was developed as part of the **Boston Consulting Group (BCG) x Forage Job Simulation** and is based on a simulated client scenario for educational purposes.
