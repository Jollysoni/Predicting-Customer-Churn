# PowerCo Customer Churn Prediction

## Overview

This project was completed as part of the **Boston Consulting Group (BCG) x Forage Job Simulation Program**.  
In this simulation, I worked as a **Junior Data Scientist**, tasked with diagnosing customer churn and building predictive models to help PowerCo — a simulated major energy utility provider — retain their SME clients.

---

## Project Context

- **Simulation Objective**: Replicate real-world data science work at a consulting firm.
- **Client (Simulated)**: PowerCo — a leading electricity and gas provider.
- **Business Problem**: Rising customer churn amid growing market competition.
- **Your Role**: Junior Data Scientist at BCG, assisting in diagnosing churn and proposing predictive solutions.

---

## Hypothesis

The primary hypothesis explored was that **price sensitivity** is the most influential factor behind customer churn.

**Initial observations**:
- Churn is relatively rare, affecting approximately **10%** of the customer base.
- A significant **class imbalance** exists between stayers and churners.

---

## Data Description

The dataset includes:
- Customer contract details
- Pricing information
- Usage patterns
- Engineered features relevant to customer decision behavior

---

## Methodology

### Feature Engineering
- Created new features based on historical usage, pricing contracts, and customer profiles.

### Modeling
- Algorithm: **Random Forest Classifier**
- Parameters:
  - `n_estimators=800`
  - `class_weight='balanced'`
- Data split: 75% training, 25% testing

### Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-Score
- Special focus on **recall for churners** (Class 1).

## Key Results

| Metric | Stayed (Class 0) | Churned (Class 1) |
|:--|:--|:--|
| Precision | 91% | 88% |
| Recall | 100% | 6% |
| F1-Score | 0.95 | 0.11 |

- **Overall model accuracy**: ~90.5%
- Strong ability to predict customers who stayed.
- Limited ability to identify customers who churned, due to extreme class imbalance.

---

## Conclusion

- The model excels in predicting customer retention.
- Class imbalance significantly impacts churner recall (~6%).
- Accuracy alone is not a sufficient evaluation metric for churn prediction.
- Future work should prioritize improving recall to capture more at-risk customers.

---

## Recommendations

- **Lower the prediction threshold** to improve recall for churners.
- **Enhance feature engineering** focused on dissatisfaction and competitive behavior.
- **Retrain models periodically** to adapt to evolving market dynamics.
- Consider **resampling techniques** or **alternative ensemble methods** for further improvement.
